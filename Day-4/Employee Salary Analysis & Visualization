//1. Display Basic Information About the Dataset:

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('employee_data.csv')
print(df.info())
print(df.describe())

//2. Find the Average Salary in Each Department:

avg_salary_by_dept = df.groupby('Department')['Salary'].mean()
print(avg_salary_by_dept)

//3. Find the Highest and Lowest Salary in the Company:

highest_salary = df['Salary'].max()
lowest_salary = df['Salary'].min()
print(f"Highest Salary: {highest_salary}")
print(f"Lowest Salary: {lowest_salary}")

//4. Find the Employee with the Maximum Salary:

max_salary_employee = df.loc[df['Salary'].idxmax()]
print(max_salary_employee)

//5. Count the Number of Employees in Each Department:

employee_count_by_dept = df['Department'].value_counts()
print(employee_count_by_dept)

//6. Plot a Bar Chart Showing the Number of Employees in Each Department:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
employee_count_by_dept.plot(kind='bar', title='Number of Employees in Each Department')
plt.xlabel('Department')
plt.ylabel('Number of Employees')
plt.show()

//7. Plot a Pie Chart Showing Salary Distribution by Department:

salary_by_dept = df.groupby('Department')['Salary'].sum()
salary_by_dept.plot(kind='pie', autopct='%1.1f%%', title='Salary Distribution by Department')
plt.ylabel('')  # Hide the y-label to make the chart cleaner
plt.show()

//8. Scatter Plot Showing Salary vs Experience:

plt.scatter(df['Experience'], df['Salary'])
plt.title('Salary vs Experience')
plt.xlabel('Experience (years)')
plt.ylabel('Salary')
plt.show()

//9. Find Employees Who Earn More Than the Average Salary:

average_salary = df['Salary'].mean()
above_average_salary_employees = df[df['Salary'] > average_salary]
print(above_average_salary_employees)

//10. Sort Employees Based on Salary in Descending Order:

sorted_employees = df.sort_values(by='Salary', ascending=False)
print(sorted_employees)
